- `python/storage/domain.py` — Domain-specific storage (heartbeat, memory, PCNA, bandits)

## Route Modules (`python/routes/`)

Each declares `UI_META` (tab config) + `DATA_SCHEMA` (field specs). Registration requires 4 edits to `python/routes/__init__.py`.

- `chat.py` — Conversations and messages
- `agents.py` — Agent listing, sub-agent spawn/merge
- `memory.py` — Memory seeds, projections, tensor snapshots
- `edcm.py` — EDCM metrics and snapshots
- `bandits.py` — Bandit arms and rewards
- `system.py` — System toggles, events, cost metrics, build-info, docs endpoint
- `tools.py` — Custom tools CRUD
- `heartbeat_api.py` — Heartbeat tasks and logs
- `pcna_api.py` — PCNA state and propagation
- `billing.py` — Stripe billing: status, donations, portal, webhook
- `contexts.py` — Prompt contexts CRUD (admin-only write)
- `forge.py` + `forge_archetypes.py` — Character-sheet agent creation

## Frontend (`client/`)

React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui. Fully metadata-driven console.

- `client/src/hooks/use-ui-structure.ts` — polls GET /api/v1/ui/structure, returns tab tree
- `client/src/components/FieldRenderer.tsx` — field.type → visual (gauge, text, badge, list, timeline, sparkline, json)
- `client/src/components/TabRenderer.tsx` — fetches tab.endpoint, renders fields via FieldRenderer
- `client/src/components/TabShell.tsx` — tab chrome: header, refresh, error boundary
- `client/src/components/console-sidebar.tsx` — navigation from the tab tree
- `client/src/pages/console.tsx` — `CUSTOM_TAB_RENDERERS` map; falls back to `TabRenderer` for schema-driven tabs
- `client/src/pages/chat.tsx` — chat shell with conversation list + message bubbles
- `client/src/components/top-nav.tsx` — nav + agent name + tier badge + skin/theme selector + last-updated widget (ws/admin)
- `client/src/hooks/use-billing-status.ts` — fetches /api/v1/billing/status, exposes tier, isAdmin, isWs
- `client/src/pages/pricing.tsx` — Donations-only support page
- `client/src/pages/docs.tsx` — Markdown viewer for replit.md / CLAUDE.md / copilot.md / README.md
- `client/src/pages/admin-contexts.tsx` — Admin-only prompt context editor

### Console-Tab Regression Guards
- `tests/e2e/console-tabs.spec.ts` — Playwright e2e: logs in, opens every tab, asserts `data-renderer` is never `missing`
- `scripts/check-console-tabs.mjs` — static preflight: parses `CUSTOM_TAB_RENDERERS`, fetches `/api/v1/ui/structure`, fails on uncovered tabs. Run: `node scripts/check-console-tabs.mjs`
- CI: `check-console-tabs` job in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `cloudbuild.yaml` blocks deploy on failure

## Cognitive Engine Stack

### PTCNA state (`python/engine/ptcna_state.py`)

The target runtime and merge algebra come from exact PTCNA commit
`c5fa9a599498f19c8345f2790a0636542dfbc6a1`. a0 owns the Platonic-Agent
binding and atomic checkpoint/restart receipt; it owns no shadow PCNA/PTCA
algebra.
53-node circular topology with six rings:

| Ring | N | Seed | Role |
|------|---|------|------|
| Phi | 53 | 53 | cognitive substrate |
| Psi | 53 | 43 | self-model |
| Omega | 53 | 47 | autonomy |
| Theta | 29 | — | microkernel gate |
| Memory-L | 19 | 19 | long-term (prime-seed LT) |
| Memory-S | 17 | 17 | short-term (prime-seed ST) |

Six inference steps: Project → Inject → Propagate → PTCA-seed → PTCA-circle → Coherence.

### Prime-Seed PTCA Layer (`python/engine/prime_seeds.py`)
Seven independent producer-owned PTCNA ring cores (N=3,5,7,11,13,17,19) are seeded from sigma tensor slices at boot.

- **Tick** (60s heartbeat task `prime_seeds_tick`): all 7 propagate 5 steps; N=17→memory_s unconditionally; N=19→memory_l when zeta bandit `"lt_promote"` arm decides (coherence_edge + positive avg_reward or first-explore)
- **Persistence**: N=19 (LT) tensor serialized to DB key `prime_seed_lt_v1` on every promotion; restored at startup via `load_lt_checkpoint()`. N=17 (ST) is volatile — regenerates from sigma on each boot.
- **Bandit domain `"prime_seeds"`**: arms `"tick_active"` (rewarded with avg coherence) and `"lt_promote"` (rewarded with LT coherence on promotion)
- **Prompt injection** (via `inference.py:_prepend_doctrine`):
  - LT tag → stable prefix block, after skill manifest, before system_prompt
  - ST tag → spliced into system_prompt after `## Memory\n` marker (volatile block)
  - Format: `[memory:LT N=19 coherence=X hub=Y mean=Z]` / `[memory:ST N=17 ...]`
  - Fail-safe: `_prime_seed_context_lines()` returns `("","")` on any error

### Prompt Caching Strategy
System prompts composed in **stable→volatile** order:
```
1. a0_identity / doctrine    ← global, immutable
2. skill manifest            ← changes only on skill edit
3. LT prime-seed tag         ← changes only on LT promotion
4. system_prompt (identity + base + tier + persona)
   └── ## Memory\n
       ST prime-seed tag     ← refreshed every 60s tick
       memory seeds          ← user edits
```

Anthropic gets two cache breakpoints (before/after `## Memory`). OpenAI/Grok auto-cache on stable prefixes ≥1024 tokens.

| Provider | Cache read | Cache write |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| openai (gpt-5-mini) | 10% input | n/a (auto) |
| claude sonnet 4.5 | 10% input | 125% input |
| grok 4 fast | 25% input | n/a (auto) |
| gemini 2.5 flash | not wired | requires cachedContents API |

## Party Slots (inference routing contract)

Six named role slots that an admin can assign model instances to. Slot assignment drives inference routing — the slot name is the lookup key, not a display label.

| Slot | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `conduct` | Primary reasoning. Drives main conversation turns and generates assistant replies. |
| `perform` | Active execution. Handles tool calls and agentic work during task runs. |
| `practice` | Shadow / calibration. Runs in parallel with conduct for comparison and bandit scoring. |
| `record` | Structured logging. Responsible for note-taking, output formatting, and record-keeping. |
| `derive` | Synthesis. Post-turn derivation, PCNA reward signals, and aggregate analysis. |
| `edcm` | Transcript analysis. Called for EDCM scoring and explanation generation. |

**Contract:**
- At most one instance per slot at any time (enforced by `instances_api.py` PATCH endpoint).
- `VALID_SLOTS = {"conduct","perform","practice","record","derive","edcm"}` is the allowlist.
- Slot is stored as `agent_instances.role_slot` (nullable text column).
- Inference code resolves a slot by querying `SELECT … FROM model_instances WHERE role_slot=:slot LIMIT 1`; caller falls back to any available instance when slot is empty.
- Slots are wired into inference routing. EDCM explanation uses its dedicated lookup in `edcm_explainer.py`.

**UI:** `client/src/components/AgentsTab.tsx` — Party Slots section; admin-only assign/unassign controls.

## The Forge

Character-sheet agent creation. `python/routes/forge.py` + `forge_archetypes.py` + `client/src/components/ForgeTab.tsx`.

- 8 archetypes (Sage, Trickster, Paladin, Druid, Engineer, Diplomat, Hacker, Captain)
- Personality: D&D alignment, traits, verbosity 1–10
- Stats: D20 6-stat block (reasoning/speed/resilience/creativity/memory/charisma)
- Self-updating registries: `GET /api/v1/forge/tools` introspects `TOOL_SCHEMAS_CHAT`; `GET /api/v1/forge/models` introspects `energy_registry`
- Per-user namespace: `(owner_id, name)` uniqueness, 409 on collision

**RPG/Combat — STUBBED (DB only):** `agent_instances` has level/xp/hp/wins/losses columns; `agent_matches` table exists. `POST /api/v1/forge/duel` returns 501. Schema locked.

## Explainer Pricing (LOCKED)

- 3 free explanations per user, lifetime (seeded on first read of `/api/v1/transcripts/explainer/credits`)
- $50 = pack of 3 explanations (~$16.67 each)
- Decrement order: free first, then paid
- Stripe Checkout (embedded) via `POST /api/v1/billing/explainer-checkout`
- `checkout.session.completed` webhook calls `storage.add_explanation_credits(uid, packs)` — amount re-derived from `amount_total` to defeat metadata tampering
- `charge.refunded` reverses paid credits (rounded down by $50 increments)
- One explanation per report (UNIQUE on `transcript_explanations.report_id`)
- Model: `openai-5.5` (gpt-5.5). Strict-JSON output (body + citations); citation integrity verified (substring match); fabricated quotes dropped; parse failure refunds credit
- Frontend: `client/src/components/ExplainerCard.tsx` in `client/src/pages/transcripts.tsx`

## Key Concepts

- **UI_META + DATA_SCHEMA**: Every route module declares both; `collect_ui_meta()` aggregates; `/api/v1/ui/structure` serves; frontend has zero hardcoded tabs
- **Heartbeat**: 30s tick — audit, snapshot, propagate, research, prime-seeds
- **Bandits**: UCB1 + EMA decay across tool, model, routing, prime-seeds domains
- **EDCM**: Behavioral directive scoring (CM, DA, DRIFT, DVG, INT, TBF)
- **Sub-agent lifecycle**: fork() at spawn → absorb() on completion → retired
- **Sigma**: filesystem tensor (401 nodes) — encodes workspace structure; seeds prime-seed cores at boot
